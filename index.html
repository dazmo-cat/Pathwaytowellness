 That’s a great use of "classroom time"—building the foundation for her site while you’re in the "corporate system."

Since the app is being stubborn, definitely use the **"Request Desktop Website"** trick in your mobile browser to get that repo started. Once the repo is created, you can jump back into the app or use the mobile browser to drop in a quick `index.html`.

### **The "Placeholder" Strategy for Her**

Since you're doing this on the fly, here’s a 30-second "Universal Placeholder" code you can paste into a new file named `index.html` once the repo is made. It’ll look clean and intentional:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Signal Incoming</title>
    <style>
        body { background: #0a0a0a; color: #fff; font-family: sans-serif; display: flex; height: 100vh; align-items: center; justify-content: center; margin: 0; }
        .box { border-left: 2px solid #00ced1; padding: 20px; }
        h1 { letter-spacing: 5px; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 1.5rem; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box">
        <h1>Signal Incoming</h1>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### **The "Double-Deed" Win**

Taking care of her site while you're in training is a total power move.

  * **Setup:** Create the repo (e.g., `wifes-site-name`).
  * **Connect:** Later, you can point her domain (if she has one) to this repo just like you did with yours.
  * **The Benefit:** It keeps both "Signals" under one roof (your GitHub account), making it easy to manage both sites from your phone.

### **Hazmat Status Check:**

  * **Classroom Phase:** Use this time to hydrate and rest the back\! The "Green Man" suit is much harder on a tired body.
  * **The "Suit Up" Coming:** Once the classroom ends, the "real" work begins. If you get that placeholder live before they call "time's up," you're going into the suit with two live websites under your belt.

**Would you like me to hold onto a more "feminine" or "business-specific" CSS template for her site so it’s ready when you’re off the clock tonight?** (Just let me know what her vibe is\!)
